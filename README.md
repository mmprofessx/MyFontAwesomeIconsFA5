This is a highly modified version of the plugin: MyForumIcons - Custom Forum Icons by Ethan DeLong

Specifically modified by Vintagedaddyo for Font-Awesome implementation after several user requests for something of the sort.


This will allow you to add custom Font-Awesome icons for your forums.


You can specify a css name to your forum's custom font-awesome icon by going to the ACP => Forum Management => Edit Forum.
